# @collabs/local-storage

Part of the Collabs library. Main package: [@collabs/collabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs).

**@collabs/local-storage** contains [LocalStorageDocStore](https://collabs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/local-storage/classes/LocalStorageDocStore.html), a storage provider that stores Collabs documents in localStorage. That way, your app can load documents quickly, even when offline.

See also: [@collabs/indexeddb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/indexeddb), which stores updates in IndexedDB instead of localStorage.
