# `@collabs/local-storage`

Part of the Collabs library. Main package: [@collabs/collabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs).

**@collabs/local-storage** contains the `LocalStorageDocStore` class. It stores updates to Collabs documents (`AbstractDoc` / `CRuntime`) in localStorage. That way, apps can load a document quickly, even without network access.

See also: [@collabs/indexeddb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/indexeddb), which stores updates in IndexedDB instead of localStorage.
