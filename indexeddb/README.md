# `@collabs/indexeddb`

Part of the Collabs library. Main package: [@collabs/collabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs).

**@collabs/indexeddb** contains the `IndexedDBDocStore` class. It stores updates to Collabs documents (`AbstractDoc` / `CRuntime`) in IndexeddDB. That way, apps can load a document quickly, even without network access.

See also: [@collabs/local-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/local-storage), which stores updates in localStorage instead of IndexedDB.
