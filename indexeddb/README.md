# @collabs/indexeddb

Part of the Collabs library. Main package: [@collabs/collabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs).

**@collabs/indexeddb** contains [IndexedDBDocStore](https://collabs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/indexeddb/classes/IndexedDBDocStore.html), a storage provider that stores Collabs documents in IndexedDB. That way, your app can load documents quickly, even when offline.

See also: [@collabs/local-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/local-storage), which stores updates in localStorage instead of IndexedDB.
