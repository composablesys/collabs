/**
 * Metadata attached to a received message in
 * [[Collab.receive]].
 *
 * The distinction between [[MessageMeta]] and the message
 * itself is that [[MessageMeta]] contains info that is not
 * specific to one [[Collab]] and can be shared between them.
 * Examples include the message's sender (included by default)
 * and a vector clock (optionally added by [[CRDTMetaLayer]]).
 *
 * Using [[MessageMeta]] instead of including such info
 * directly in the messages allows for efficiency improvements:
 * - Collabs don't need to store any state needed for
 * construction metadata (e.g., a current vector clock).
 * This deduplicates state, and also allows Collabs to be
 * garbage collected even if they depend on nontrivial
 * global state.
 * - If multiple Collabs send messages that depend on the same
 * metadata, and those messages get batched together
 * by [[BatchingLayer]], the batch need only include
 * the metadata once, instead of once within each message.
 *
 * By default, [[MessageMeta]] only includes the metadata
 * specified here. However, a Collab may choose to add
 * extra metadata before delivering messages to its
 * descendants. To do so, it should set values in the
 * index signature, keyed by a Symbol unique to that type
 * of metadata (e.g., specified in the metadata's class
 * as a constant). It should also define the
 * [[MessageMeta.NEXT_MESSAGE_META]] key for
 * [[ICollabParent.getAddedContext]].
 * See [[CRDTMetaLayer.getAddedContext]] for an example.
 *
 * A Collab may depend on specific extra metadata being present.
 * In that case, one of its ancestors must add the
 * metadata to each MessageMeta before delivering it to
 * the descendant. If required extra metadata is
 * missing (`undefined`), the Collab should throw an error
 * describing how to supply it, e.g.,, what ancestor class is
 * needed.
 *
 * Except for adding values to the index signature, [[MessageMeta]] should
 * be treated as immutable.
