/**
 * Extra field on [[MessageMeta]] that gives metadata
 * relevant to CRDTs.
 *
 * Keyed by [[CRDTMeta.MESSAGE_META_KEY]].
 *
 * The easiest way to access this extra metadata is by
 * subclassing [[PrimitiveCRDT]]. It provides an abstract
 * method [[PrimitiveCRDT.receiveCRDT]] in place of
 * [[Collab.receive]], which receives the [[CRDTMeta]]
 * as an argument.
 *
 * To ensure access to [[CRDTMeta]], a [[Collab]] must
 * be a descendant of [[CRDTMetaLayer]] in the tree
 * of [[Collab]]s. Using [[CRDTApp]] ensures this
 * for all [[Collab]]s.
 *
 * All messages in the same [transaction](../../transactions.md)
 * will have the same [[CRDTMeta]]. In particular,
 * [[senderCounter]] and [[lamportTimestamp]] may be repeated
 * for the same sender, so they cannot be
 * used as part of a unique identifer
 * (see [[Runtime.getReplicaUniqueNumber]] instead).
 *
 * [[vectorClockGet]] values, [[wallClockTime]],
 * and [[lamportTimestamp]] are not included by default.
 * Instead, they must be requested from the ambient
 * [[CRDTExtraMetaRequestee]], accessed via
 *  [[Collab.getContext]]([[CRDTMetaRequestee.CONTEXT_KEY]]).
 * The easiest way to do this is again to subclass
 * [[PrimitiveCRDT]]; its [[PrimitiveCRDT.sendCRDT]] method takes
 * requests as an argument. Notes:
 * - You may succeed at accessing a field you did not request,
 * if it was included due to another request in the same
 * transaction or (for vector clock entries) if it was included
 * for causal ordering purposes.
 * - If you attempt to access a field you did not request,
 * it may fail on the sending replica but succeed on
 * remote replicas. This happens if the field was requested
 * by a later message in the same transaction.
