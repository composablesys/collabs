List on npm: [Collabs org](https://www.npmjs.com/org/collabs)

- [@collabs/collabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs): Main package; includes data structures for local-first collaborative apps. Internally, it is just the combination of [@collabs/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/core) and [@collabs/crdts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/crdts).
- [@collabs/container](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/container): Tools for [Collabs containers](../containers.md) (network-agnostic collaborative apps), including the entry point class `CRDTContainer`.
- [@collabs/container-testing-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/container-testing-server): Simple server for testing [Collabs containers](../containers.md). Provides the `container-testing-server` CLI command.
- [@collabs/matrix-widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/matrix-widget): Provides `MatrixWidgetNetwork`, a demo network that connects a @collabs/collabs `CRDTApp` to the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) network inside a widget. You can try it out using [our demo server](https://compoventuals-tests.herokuapp.com/#matrix), which lets you run any [container](../containers.md) over Matrix.
- [@collabs/ws-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/ws-client): Provides `WebSocketNetwork`, a demo network that connects a @collabs/collabs `CRDTApp` to a [@collabs/ws-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/ws-server) server over WebSockets.
- [@collabs/ws-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/ws-server): NodeJS server for [@collabs/ws-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/ws-client).
- [@collabs/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/core): Subset of [@collabs/collabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs) including only the parts of Collabs that are applicable to general collaborative data structures (i.e., message-driven replicated data types), not just Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). Use this if you are developing a non-CRDT extension to Collabs, e.g., a library for collaborative data structures that are managed by a central server.
- [@collabs/crdts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/crdts): Subset of [@collabs/collabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs) including only the Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). Usually you will import [@collabs/collabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs) instead of this package, to avoid having to figure out where each import comes from. (All client-side packages use ES6 modules in a tree shakeable way, so you shouldn't need to worry about bundle size from importing @collabs/collabs.)
