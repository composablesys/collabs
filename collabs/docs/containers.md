# Containers

Coming soon

<!-- TODO: novel container hosts (copy container-testing-server code with your own network, saving); also see matrix-container-host once that exists

## Deployment

TODO: deployment (which files and what to do with them). For containers, choose between single file (inline everything with Webpack) vs static site deployment (set publicPath; allow CORS for main file, so hosts can get it with AJAX; understand implications of the first file being downloaded vs rest loaded on-demand - offline support, CORS, sandboxing; github pages is a free option, check if it has right CORS).

TODO: make sure CORS okay, for hosts that get by URL. Else your users will have to download and re-upload. Or they can point the host at it directly?

When making your own project, depending on how you configure Webpack, you might end up with output files besides just the HTML file (e.g., non-inlined images). You'll need to distribute those files as well. TODO: how; also webpack config for inline vs not.
