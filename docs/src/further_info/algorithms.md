## Replication Model

Collabs implements hybrid op-based/state-based [Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)](https://crdt.tech/). This means that you can share updates using both _messages_ (op-based CRDT usage) and _saved states_ (state-based CRDT usage), as described in [Updates and Sync](./updates.html).

In a Collab implementation, [send](../api/collabs/classes/Collab.html#send) and [receive](../api/collabs/classes/Collab.html#receive) correspond to op-based CRDT usage, while [save](../api/collabs/classes/Collab.html#save) and [load](../api/collabs/classes/Collab.html#load) correspond to state-based usage.

### References

- [Yjs's document updates](https://docs.yjs.dev/api/document-updates) use a similar hybrid op-based/state-based model, except its API does not distinguish between op-based messages and state-based states (both are just "updates").
- [Automerge's changes and saved states](https://automerge.org/docs/tsapi/index/) use the same hybrid op-based/state-based model.
- [Delta State Replicated Data Types](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2017.08.003) (Paulo Sérgio Almeida, Ali Shoker, and Carlos Baquero) use a different hybrid of op-based and state-based CRDTs. Specifically, they augment state-based CRDTs with "deltas": incremental states that are still mergeable but that only describe a single operation, like an op-based message.
- [Making Operation-based CRDTs Operation-based](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-43352-2_11) (Carlos Baquero, Paulo Sérgio Almeida, Ali Shoker) describes _Pure Op-based CRDTs_: op-based CRDTs in which the sent message is a function of the operation only, not the CRDT's current state. All of our CRDTs except list types are pure. This is possible due to [CRDTMessageMeta](../api/collabs/interfaces/CRDTMessageMeta.html), which implements the "tag" portion of the paper's _Tagged Reliable Causal Broadcast_.
- We use [vector clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock) to track the causal order and as provided metadata. To keep network messages small, though, we don't send the whole vector clock in each message. Instead, we only send "necessary" vector clock entries: a minimal set of causal dependencies (like [Martin Kleppmann describes for Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-classic/issues/28)), and any entries accessed by the sender's own `Collab.receive` function (which usually suffice for _all_ receivers - e.g., see the comment in [`CMultiValueMap.set`](https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/blob/master/crdts/src/map/c_multi_value_map.ts)'s implementation).
