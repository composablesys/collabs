# User Presence

Many collaborative apps display "user presence", i.e., what others are doing. For example, collaborative text editors show other users' cursor positions.

Our user presence support is in its early stages. So far, we provide [`CCursor`](../api/collabs/classes/CCursor.html), a `Collab` representing a cursor position in a `CList`. More data structures and usage info are coming soon.

<!-- TODO: example of using CCursor; also how to do it without tombstones (forget entries eventually, even though it's not EC.)  -->
