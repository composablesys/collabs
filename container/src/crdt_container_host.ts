 *
 * A `CRDTContainerHost` connects to the `CRDTContainer`
 * instance running in the `containerIFrame` provided to
 * the constructor. All messages sent by the `CRDTContainer`
 * become messages sent by this class, and likewise for
 * received messages. This class's save data is also
 * derived from the container's own save data, and likewise,
 * the container is loaded based on the save data passed to [[load]].
 *
 * You are responsible for blocking user input to `containerIFrame`
 * until [[isContainerReady]] is true (signalled by the
 * "ContainerReady" event). Otherwise, the user might interact
 * with the container before it is loaded, causing errors.
 * Typically, you'll also want to hide the `containerIFrame`
 * until then, so that the user doesn't see partially-initialized
 * state. You can accomplish both by setting
 * `containerIFrame.hidden = true`, then when it is ready,
 * setting `containerIFrame.hidden = false`.
 *
 * You can use `CRDTContainerHost` to embed Collabs containers
 * inside your own app. In particular, if you want to
 * support a specific network/storage/UX/etc. for containers,
 * you can do so by making a Collabs app
 * that uses your chosen network/storage/UX/etc.,
 * with a `CRDTContainerHost` as its single Collab, and with
 * some way for users to specify the container.
