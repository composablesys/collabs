/**
 * Entrypoint for a Collabs container: a network-agnostic,
 * self-contained collaborative app that is deployed using static
 * files only.
 *
 * See [container docs](https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/blob/master/collabs/docs/containers.md).
 *
 * This class is similar to, and replaces, @collabs/collabs
 * `CRDTApp` class as the Collabs entrypoint. This means that
 * it is the first thing you construct when using Collabs,
 * and you register your top-level (global variable) Collabs
 * using [[registerCollab]]. Unlike `CRDTApp`, there are no
 * methods/events for sending or receiving messages or for
 * saving and loading; those are handled for you.
 * Specifically, those happen via communication with an instance
 * of [[CRDTContainerHost]] running in a separate window
 * (currently assumed to be `window.parent`).
 *
 * As the name suggests, `CRDTContainer` is specifically designed for use
 * with `Collab`s that are (op-based) CRDTs. Currently, this includes
 * all `Collab`s that come built-in with @collabs/collabs.
 *
 * ## `CRDTContainer` Lifecycle
 *
 * After construction a `CRDTContainer`, you must first
 * register your Collabs using [[registerCollab]].
 * Afterwards, you must eventually call [[load]], await
 * its Promise, and then call [[ready]]. Only then can you
 * use the `CRDTContainer`, i.e., you can perform `Collab`
 * operations and the container will deliver messages
 * to the `Collab`s.
 *
 * See the
 * [container docs](https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/blob/master/collabs/docs/containers.md)
 * for step-by-step instructions on when to call these methods
 * during your app's setup.
