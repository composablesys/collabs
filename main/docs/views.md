# Views

TODO: using a view of some collaborative state will also be EC, without having to make it a collaborative data type. Sometimes an opt, sometimes necessary. Examples: collection sizes; sorted view of set. Interaction with loading (need to postLoad or store yourself) - usually the only time you have to deal with load/saving if you are writing a CObject.

TODO: do we need a whole page for this, or should it just
be part of the CObject docs? I guess you can have views outside
CObject's (e.g. the GUI)?

TODO: Distinguish this vs view in the sense of MVC
