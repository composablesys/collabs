# Views

TODO: using a view of some collaborative state will also be EC, without having to make it a collaborative data type. Sometimes an opt, sometimes necessary. Examples: collection sizes; sorted view of set. Interaction with loading (need to postLoad or store yourself) - usually the only time you have to deal with load/saving if you are writing a CObject.
