- varying initialization (not synchronous; depends on local state, like time or replicaId). Either which constructors are called, or what arguments.
- operations out of turn (in event handlers; during initialization/valueConstructors - for deleting structures, you can get around this by doing the ops just after initialization; anything that calls the op on every replica instead of just one)
- non-unique names (registerCrdt, addChild). Not as bad because it will error the first time you try.
- not register a Crdt (should be hard due to CrdtInitToken - don't forge these).
  - should mention somewhere what's going on here (with Pre), how to get concrete instances.
- everyone should be running same version. TODO for later: compatibility guide.
- how to use valueConstructors
- loading gotchas (performing ops before loading (block the user input in case loading takes some time); not setting up full state before loading; using ContainerRuntimeSource's auto load-after-first-thread but not setting up full state in the first thread)
