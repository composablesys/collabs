# Collabs json-opt

Example JSON CRDT built on top of the Collabs library---optimized version.

This is a demo that the library can easily build complicated CRDTs compositionally, and optimize existing data types (here the [other Collabs JSON example](../json/README.md)). It is not intended for production use, but you are free to use or modify it for your own apps.

The semantics are inspired by, but not quite identical to, ["A Conflict-Free Replicated JSON Datatype"](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2017/04/24/json-crdt.html) by Martin Kleppmann and Alastair Beresford.
