# Collabs json

Example JSON CRDT built on top of the Collabs library.

This is a demo that the library can easily build complicated CRDTs compositionally. It is not intended for production use, but you are free to use or modify it for your own apps.

The semantics are inspired by, but not quite identical to, ["A Conflict-Free Replicated JSON Datatype"](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2017/04/24/json-crdt.html) by Martin Kleppmann and Alastair Beresford.
