        Each link leads to a collaborative app. Anyone who visits that page can
        make edits and (hopefully) see the same state. Try it out by opening a
        demo in multiple tabs or using it at the same time as a friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Collabs is alpha software, and the demos are prototypes. So
        errors or inconsistencies (different users seeing different states) may
        occur. This is especially true for demos marked "(experimental)", which
        try out new or more complex library features. Additionally, the server
        occasionally resets when no one is using it, erasing the demos' states.
      </p>

      <a id="matrix"><h2>Usage Over Matrix</h2></a>
      <p>
        You can also run the above demos over
        <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>, using a Matrix room (group
        chat) to communicate instead of this server.
      </p>

      <p>To add a demo to a Matrix room:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Copy the "Matrix widget command" from the demo's "More Info" page.
          E.g., for the rich text editor, it is<br />
          <code id="command"></code><br />
          <button id="copy">Copy</button>
          <script>
            {
              const loc = window.location;
              const command = document.getElementById("command");
              const commandText = `/addwidget ${loc.protocol}//${loc.host}/matrix.html?container=demos/rich-text/dist/rich_text.html`;
              command.innerHTML = commandText;
              document.getElementById("copy").addEventListener("click", () => {
                navigator.clipboard.writeText(commandText);
              });
            }
          </script>
        </li>
        <li>
          Send that command as a message to the room. This adds the widget.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now or later, open the widget using a widget-capable Matrix client.
          E.g., in <a href="https://app.element.io/">Element Web</a>: click
          "Room Info" in the top-right, then select "Custom Widget".
        </li>
      </ol>

      When you use Matrix instead of the above links:

      <ul>
        <li>Your edits are private, only visible within the room.</li>
        <li>
          Someday in the future, the demo's state will be saved within the room,
          so that it acts as a long-lived document. This is currently flaky, so
          it's best to only use the demo with all collaborators online at once
          (<a href="https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/issues/209"
            >track progress</a
          >).
        </li>
        <li>
          You're not dependent on this site for communication, only for static
          content.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <a id="containers"><h2>Demo Containers</h2></a>

      <p>
        All of the demos are packaged as
        <a
          href="https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/blob/master/collabs/docs/containers.md"
          >Collabs containers</a
        >
        that you can run on the network of your choice. Specifically, you can
        run the container in any "container host", which handles networking and
        storage for the container. This is how we deploy our demos both on this
        server and over Matrix: each runs a container host, while the demo is
        compiled only once.
        <a href="web_socket.html?container=demos/selector/dist/selector.html"
          >Selector</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="web_socket.html?container=demos/tile-board/dist/tile_board.html"
          >Tile Board</a
        >
        also run nested apps this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each demo's "More Info" page has a download link that you can use to
        download or link to its container. You can provide this file/link to a
        container host run by someone else, or to
        <a href="web_socket.html?container=demos/selector/dist/selector.html"
          >Selector</a
        >
        or
        <a
          href="web_socket.html?container=demos/tile-board/dist/tile_board.html"
          >Tile Board</a
        >
        when they ask for a file/URL. Unless noted otherwise, the file is an
        HTML file that includes all of the demo's code and dependencies. This
        means that if you download the file now, you can use it later in a
        (version-compatible) container host, even if this website goes down.
      </p>

      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        Collabs (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs">npm</a
        >, <a href="https://github.com/composablesys/collabs">Github</a>) is a
        TypeScript library for building and using
        <i>collaborative data structures</i>. This site demos collaborative apps
        built on top of the library, made by Collabs contributors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The demos linked above connect users via this server and don't really
        support offline editing. However, in principle, they can run on top of
        any network (Matrix, WebRTC, someone else's server, a mix, etc.) and
        continue working offline, syncing changes later. They can also be
        downloaded (link on each demo's "More Info" page) and used indefinitely,
        unlike traditional cloud-based collaborative apps, which can go away at
        any time.
