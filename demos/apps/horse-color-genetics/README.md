# Horse Color Genetics Demo

A collaborative app where you edit a horse's genes and observe the effects on its coat color, as a [Collabs container](https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/blob/master/collabs/docs/containers.md).

This is a collaborative version of an app by [Jennifer Hoffman](http://www.jenniferhoffman.net/). Original app:
[https://horse.jenniferhoffman.net/horse-color-genetics.html](https://horse.jenniferhoffman.net/horse-color-genetics.html). Since the original app is CC-BY-NC-SA-3.0 licensed, so is this version.

Container organization based off of [template-container](https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/tree/master/template-container).

## Installation

First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Then run `npm i`.

## Commands

### `npm run dev`

Build the container from `src/`, in [development mode](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/).

### `npm run build`

Build the container from `src/`, in [production mode](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/) (smaller output files; longer build time; no source maps).

### `npm run start:standalone`

Run the testing server for the "standalone" deployment (see below). Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view. Use multiple browser windows at once to test collaboration.

See [@collabs/container-testing-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/container-testing-server) for usage info.

### `npm run start:multi`

Same as `npm run start:standalone`, but for the "multi" deployment (see below).

### `npm run clean`

Delete `dist/`.

## Deployment

There are two deployment builds:

- `dist/standalone/horse-color-genetics.html` is a standalone (no dependency) compiled container. It can used in any container host. However, it is rather large (30 MB, 20MB gzipped) and thus loads slowly.
- `dist/multi/horse-color-genetics.html` is a compiled container, but is not standalone; it leaves out the images, which are instead other files in `dist/multi/`. These images must be hosted on a static site somewhere, and their location must be specified with an absolute URL in `webpack-multi.config.ts`'s `publicPath` field. An absolute URL is necessary because a host might load the container HTML file as a data URL instead of from its original site, in which case paths relative to the HTML file will not point to the site.
