  "description": "A collaborative app where you edit a horse's genes and observe the effects on its coat color.<p>This is a collaborative version of an app by <a href=\"http://www.jenniferhoffman.net/\">Jennifer Hoffman</a>. Original app: <a href=\"https://horse.jenniferhoffman.net/horse-color-genetics.html\">https://horse.jenniferhoffman.net/horse-color-genetics.html</a>. Since the original app is CC-BY-NC-SA-3.0 licensed, so is this version.</p><p></p>The demo comes in two versions, standalone and multi-file. Standalone bundles all assets (including images) into a single file, which you can download below and use without access to this server. This has better longevity, but is 20MB and loads slowly. Multi-file instead fetches images from this server, so it requires a network connection and this server's existence.</p>",
