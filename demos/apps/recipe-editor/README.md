# Recipe Editor Demo

A collaborative recipe editor, using [@collabs/ws-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/ws-client) and [@collabs/ws-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/ws-server) to connect users via a WebSocket server.

This demo uses React and [@collabs/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/react):

- [useCollab](https://collabs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/react/modules.html#useCollab) to control rerenders.
- [CollabsTextInput](https://collabs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/react/modules.html#CollabsTextInput) for each Ingredient text field.

It also uses a copy of our [rich-text demo](../rich-text) for the Instructions editor.

[fileshare-recipe-editor](https://github.com/mweidner037/fileshare-recipe-editor/) uses the same GUI but syncs changes through Dropbox instead of our own server. We demonstrated it at [LFW.dev](https://localfirstweb.dev/) meetup #5: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0nzsxhoToo&t=2346s), [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13I3L76R-wwiXxgTXI2ide3zlbjiWoTWXMSU9YbQdYXU/edit?usp=sharing).
