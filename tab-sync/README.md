# `@collabs/tab-sync`

Part of the Collabs library. Main package: [@collabs/collabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs).

**@collabs/tab-sync** contains the `TabSyncNetwork` class. It syncs updates to Collabs documents (`AbstractDoc` / `CRuntime`) across tabs using BroadcastChannel. That way, a user with multiple tabs open sees their changes sync quickly, even without network access.
