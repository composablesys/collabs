# @collabs/tab-sync

Part of the Collabs library. Main package: [@collabs/collabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs).

**@collabs/tab-sync** contains [TabSyncNetwork](https://collabs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tab-sync/classes/TabSyncNetwork.html), a network provider that shares updates across local tabs using BroadcastChannel. That way, a user with multiple tabs open sees their changes sync quickly, even when offline.
