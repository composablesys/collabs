**Collabs CRDTs**

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/crdts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/crdts)

This package includes the Collabs library's built-in Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).

For local-first collaborative apps (Collabs's main use case), it is easier to import [@collabs/collabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs), which re-exports this package plus [@collabs/crdts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/crdts). This package exists to separate out the CRDTs from [@collabs/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/core), which contains the parts of Collabs that generalize beyond CRDTs.
