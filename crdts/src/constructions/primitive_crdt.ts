 * Superclass for a primitive (message-passing)
 * operation-based CRDT.
 *
 * Messages sent with [[sendCRDT]] are delivered to all
 * replica's [[receiveCRDT]] methods (including the sender's)
 * exactly once, in causal order, and tagged with
 * [[CRDTMessageMeta]]. Sent messages are delivered to the local
 * replica immediately. Subclasses are expected to implement
 * an operation-based CRDT algorithm using these methods.
 *
 * Besides renaming send and receive to sendCRDT and receiveCRDT,
 * the only user-facing difference between [[PrimitiveCRDT]]
 * and [[CPrimitive]] is that this class supplies
 * [[CRDTMessageMeta]] to recipients.
 *
 * To function, a [[PrimitiveCRDT]] must have an ancestor
 * that supplies the extra [[MessageMeta]] key
 * [[CRDTMeta.MESSAGE_META_KEY]] (typically [[CRDTMetaLayer]]). Also, its ancestors
 * must deliver messages exactly once, in causal order,
 * with sent messages delivered to the local replica immediately.

   * [[CRDTMeta]] fields used by [[receiveCRDT]] must be requested in

   * which are always included). Possible requests are:
   * - `vectorClockEntries`: Include the vector clock entries with the
   * specified keys (`replicaID`'s). Non-requested entries may return 0
   * instead of their correct value (as if no messages had been received from
   * that replica).
   * - `wallClockTime`: If true, include non-null [[CRDTMeta.wallClockTime]].
   * - `lamportTimestamp`: If true, nclude non-null [[CRDTMeta.lamportTimestamp]].
   * - `all`: If true, include all metadata, including all vector clock entries.
   * Use this with caution, since the number of vector clock entries may be
   * very large.
   * - `automatic`: If true, include any metadata that are accessed during
   * the sender's own [[receiveCRDT]] call, i.e., during the local echo.
   * This is sufficient for most use cases, but you
   * should think carefully through the steps that
   * remote recipients would take, and ensure that they
   * only need to access the same metadata as the sender.
   * In particular, ensure that it is okay for
   * remote replicas to see incorrect 0 entries in
   * the vector clock, so long as that only happens with
   * entries not accessed by the sender.
