/**
 * The entrypoint for a Collabs CRDT app.
 *
 * `CRDTApp` manages a group of CRDT [[Collab]]s, i.e.,
 * [[Collab]]s that are (op-based) CRDTs. (Currently, this includes
 * all `Collab`s that come built-in with @collabs/collabs.)
 * `CRDTApp` lets you register [[Collab]]s and then use them.
 * In return, you must provide networking and storage.
 *
 * For networking, whenever this replica sends a message
 * (the "Send" event), that message must be delivered
 * to every other replica's [[recieve]] method, eventually
 * at-least-once.
 *
 * For storage, you must ensure that when a new replica
 * is created, it eventually learns of all prior messages.
 * The `CRDTApp` can learn of a message either by calling
 * [[receive]] on it as usual, or by calling [[load]] with
 * save data from a call to a previous instance's [[save]]
 * method that happened after sending or receiving that message.
 * Save data will generally be smaller than the full message log,
 * and it will also load faster than replaying every message
 * in the log.
 *
 * See the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/blob/master/collabs/docs/getting_started_guide.md).
 * `CRDTApp` corresponds to the "app" template (not the "container"
 * template, which uses the alternative class `CRDTContainer`
 * from package @collabs/container).
 *
 * ## `CRDTApp` Lifecycle
 *
 * After construction a `CRDTApp`, you must first
 * register your Collabs using [[registerCollab]].
 * Afterwards, you must eventually call [[load]],
 * even if you do not have prior save data to load
 * (in that case, use [[Optional.empty]]`()` as the argument).
 *  Only then can you
 * use the `CRDTApp`, i.e., you can perform `Collab`
 * operations and call [[receive]].
