# Collabs Monorepo

You're probably looking for [@collabs/collabs](https://github.com/composablesys/collabs#readme).

## Packages in this repo

See folders in this directory.

## Top-level npm package

You can probably ignore the npm package defined in this folder. Instead, run `npm i` in whichever subfolder(s) you are working on.

The exception is if you are changing multiple projects at once without publishing the changed depenencies first. In that case you should run `npm i` in this folder; that sets up the subfolders as npm workspaces.
