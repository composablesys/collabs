/**
 * protobuf.js's output js file (generated_esm/proto_compiled.js)
 * is not amenable to Webpack tree-shaking, even thought it is in ES6
 * module mode, because:
 * - it uses IIFE's to define its classes.
 * - it adds a copy of each class to the $root variable, which
 * is global within the file.
 *
 * These each individually make Webpack (really UglifyJS) concerned
 * that each class definition may have side effects, so when
 * bundling a webapp that uses collabs, Webpack chooses
 * to include the entire proto_compiled.js file even if the
 * app only uses a few messages from it.
 * See https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/issues/1261#issuecomment-285203500
 * That is a problem
 * since the file is quite large (currently 580 KB plain,
 * ~100 KB minified).
 *
 * This script is run during the build:protobuf process to
 * automatically refactor proto_compiled.js so that Webpack
 * will accept it.
 *
 * Note that this script may break when the protobuf.js version
 * is changed, since it depends on the exact output format.
 * Currently the version is pinned to 6.9.0 because
 * protobuf.js >= 6.10 es6 module exports have a bug
 * (https://github.com/protobufjs/protobuf.js/issues/1452).
 * Also, it deletes the default export $root.  TODO: if we run
 * this before pbts, perhaps .d.ts file will reflect this.
 *
 * Also note that this hackery is independent of the hackery
 * described in tsconfig.json (comment on the "includes" field),
 * which also concerns generated_esm/proto_compiled.js.
