/**
 * **Experimental/flaky - use with caution**
 *
 * Layer that allows you to run operations on its descendants
 * locally only, not as a replicated operation, by calling
 * [[runLocally]].
 *
 * Typically, you will call [[runLocally]] in response to
 * a message broadcast to all replicas (e.g., using
 * [[CMessenger]]), so that all replicas run the same
 * operation. This is supposed to give the same result as
 * if the message's sender had run `doPureOps` normally.
 * However, ensuring this requires some care; see
 * [[runLocally]].
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - Optimizing bulk operations. For example, in a drawing tool,
 * suppose a user draws a 1,000x1,000 filled rectangle. The easy
 * way to implement this is by setting each of the 1,000,000
 * pixels to the intended color as a replicated operation.
 * However, this will result in 1,000,000 messages being sent.
 * You can instead use a [[CMessenger]] to send a short
 * description
 * of the operation (e.g., the rectangle's coordinates and
 * fill color), then each replica uses [[runLocally]] to do
 * the actual fill operation in response to that message.
 * - Together with [[SemidirectProductStore]]. [[SemidirectProductStore]]
 * concerns modifying sent operations based on concurrent
 * operations. To make this possible, it is easiest to send
 * a high-level description of each operation using
 * [[CMessenger]], modify it using [[SemidirectProductStore]],
 * then perform the modified operation using [[runLocally]].
 *
 * ## Experimental
 * This class is experimental. Using it may break certain
 * assumptions made by the library, due to its "magic"
 * nature. See [https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/issues](https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/issues).
