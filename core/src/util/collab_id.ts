/**
 * A replica-independent ID for a [[Collab]].
 *
 * A `CollabID` can be used to unambiguously refer to (replicas of) the same
 * [[Collab]] on different users. In particular, [[CollabIDSerializer]] and
 * [[DefaultSerializer]]
 * can serialize [[CollabID]]s.
 * Those serializers allow you to add `CollabID`s to collections, as a way of
 * adding (pointers to) `Collab`s to collections beside their parents.
 * (See also [[CollabSerializer]], which is a more convenient option when
 * you guarantee that your `Collab`s will never be deleted.)
 *
 * For example, suppose you have a `Collab` class `CNote` representing a note
 * on a collaborative note board. You can use a [[DeletingMutCSet]] to
 * create new `CNote`s. To let users archive notes and restore them later,
 * you can store the IDs of "present" (non-archived) notes in an
 * [[AddWinsCSet]]`<CollabID<CNote>>`. Then `add` and `delete` operations
 * on the `AddWinsCSet` will change which IDs (hence notes) are present,
 * without affecting the `CNote`s themselves - unlike [[DeletingMutCSet.delete]]
 * on the original set, which deletes `CNote`s permanently (making them
 * unusable). This is precisely how [[ArchivingMutCSet]] works.
 *
 * A [[CollabID]] from one [[Runtime]] can be used within
 * another. Continuing the `CNote` example, perhaps the [[AddWinsCSet]]
 * storing "present" notes has different permissions from the notes themselves,
 * e.g., only moderators can archive notes. One way to accomplish this is
 * to store that [[AddWinsCSet]] in a different [[Runtime]] using a different
 * network. That set will still work as expected, i.e., it will correctly
 * serialize and deserialize `CollabID`s. But when turning `CollabID`s back
 * into `CNote`s, you must be sure to pass the `CNote`s' runtime into
 * [[get]] (not the `AddWinsCSet`'s runtime).
 *
 * ## Getting `Collab`s and (Non-)Existence
 *
 * [[get]] converts a `CollabID` into the local replica of its `Collab`,
 * or `undefined` if that `Collab` no longer exists.
 * Whether a `Collab` exists or not is up to its ancestors and is a function
 * of the collaborative, not local, state.
 *
 * For example, after [[DeletingMutCSet.delete]] is called, the deleted value
 * and its descendants no longer exist. This is because [[DeletingMutCSet]]
 * forgets deleted values. The same is true of [[DeletingMutCList]],
 * [[DeletingMutCMap]], and (causally) overwritten values in [[MutCVariable]].
 *
 * Warnings:
 * - When you send a `CollabID` over the network (e.g., by adding it to
 * a Collabs collection), even if the corresponding `Collab` existed on
 * the sender, it may be deleted by the time other users receive the message.
 * For example, this can happen if the `Collab` is concurrently deleted from
 * a [[DeletingMutCSet]].
 * - A `Collab` may "not exist" (i.e., [[get]] returns `undefined`) even if
 * you have a local copy of it in memory. For example, if you store
 * a `Collab` in a variable, then call [[DeletingMutCSet.delete]] on it,
 * then your variable will still point to your local replica of that `Collab`,
 * but the [[DeletingMutCSet]] (and other users) will consider it non-existent.
 *
 * ## Internals
 *
 * [[namePath]]`()` is the content of this `CollabID`, i.e., the concrete,
 * serializable piece of information that uniquely identifies its [[Collab]]
 * in a replica-independent way. `Collab`s are converted to
 * name paths and vice-versa using [[Runtime.getNamePath]] and
 * [[Runtime.getDescendant]], or [[Collab.getNamePath]]
 * and [[Collab.getDescendant]] if you specify a [[Collab]] ancestor.
